- [ ] Other roles (Manager, Exam Officer, Teacher, Account Officer) cannot access Settings app
- [ ] Settings app loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Proper error boundaries and loading states

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create `SettingsApp.jsx` component with role-based routing
- Implement admin-only route guards
- Design settings navigation sidebar
- Add Settings app to main navigation context

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] **TDD**: Unit tests for role-based access control written first
- [ ] **TDD**: Integration tests for navigation access
- [ ] **Regression**: Existing navigation functionality unaffected
- [ ] **Smoke**: Administrator can access Settings, other roles cannot
- [ ] **Performance**: <2s load time verified
- [ ] **Mobile**: Responsive design validated
- [ ] **Security**: Role-based access enforced
- [ ] **Code Review**: Approved and documented

### **Story 1.2: Feature Visibility Matrix Interface**
**Priority**: Highest | **Points**: 5 | **Type**: Core Feature

**As an** Administrator  
**I want** a visual matrix showing all features and which roles can access them  
**So that** I can understand and configure the current permission system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Matrix displays all features (Expenses, Exams, Settings components)
- [ ] Matrix shows all 5 roles (Administrator, Manager, Exam Officer, Teacher, Account Officer)
- [ ] Current permissions are accurately displayed
- [ ] Interface clearly shows enabled/disabled states
- [ ] Matrix is sortable and filterable
- [ ] Read-only view with clear visual design

**Technical Requirements:**
- Create `FeatureMatrix.jsx` component with table interface
- Implement role-permission data service
- Design visual indicators for enabled/disabled features
- Add sorting and filtering capabilities

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] **TDD**: Permission matrix logic tested with all 5 roles
- [ ] **TDD**: Component rendering tests for all permission states
- [ ] **Integration**: Matrix accurately reflects current system permissions
- [ ] **Regression**: No changes to actual permissions (read-only)
- [ ] **Smoke**: All features and roles displayed correctly
- [ ] **Performance**: Matrix loads within 1 second
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance verified
- [ ] **Documentation**: Feature matrix documented

### **Story 1.3: Feature Toggle Configuration**
**Priority**: High | **Points**: 5 | **Type**: Core Feature

**As an** Administrator  
**I want** to enable/disable features for specific roles  
**So that** I can control what functionality each user type can access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Toggle switches for each role-feature combination
- [ ] Changes are immediately saved to the database
- [ ] Confirmation dialog for critical feature changes
- [ ] Dependency validation (e.g., disabling ExpenseViewer disables Analytics)
- [ ] Bulk operations for common configurations
- [ ] Audit trail of permission changes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement toggle UI components with immediate persistence
- Create dependency validation system
- Design confirmation dialogs for breaking changes
- Add audit logging for permission changes

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] **TDD**: Toggle functionality tested for all role-feature combinations
- [ ] **TDD**: Dependency validation tests (25+ scenarios)
- [ ] **Integration**: Changes immediately reflected in user interfaces
- [ ] **Regression**: Existing user permissions preserved during changes
- [ ] **Smoke**: Administrator can successfully toggle features on/off
- [ ] **Security**: Only administrators can modify permissions
- [ ] **Performance**: Toggle responses within 500ms
- [ ] **Audit**: All permission changes logged with timestamp and admin user

### **Story 1.4: User Management Interface**
**Priority**: High | **Points**: 3 | **Type**: Management Feature

**As an** Administrator  
**I want** to view and manage all users in the system  
**So that** I can assign roles and manage user accounts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] List all users with current roles and status
- [ ] Filter users by role, department, or status
- [ ] Search users by name or email
- [ ] Quick role assignment interface
- [ ] User activation/deactivation controls
- [ ] Bulk operations for user management

**Technical Requirements:**
- Extend existing UserManager component for Settings app context
- Implement user filtering and search capabilities
- Create bulk operation interfaces
- Add user status management

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] **TDD**: User management operations tested for all scenarios
- [ ] **TDD**: Role assignment validation tests
- [ ] **Integration**: User changes immediately reflected across all apps
- [ ] **Regression**: Existing UserManager functionality preserved
- [ ] **Smoke**: Administrator can manage all user operations
- [ ] **Security**: Proper authorization for all user operations
- [ ] **Performance**: User list loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Validation**: Input validation and error handling implemented
