## üó∫Ô∏è **DEPENDENCY MAPPING**

### **Critical Path Dependencies**
```
Settings App Foundation ‚Üí 5-Role System ‚Üí Exam Management ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Integration
```

### **Story Dependencies**
1. **Settings Foundation** (No dependencies - Starting point)
2. **Role System** depends on Settings configuration framework
3. **Exam Management** depends on 5-role system and Settings configuration
4. **Notification System** depends on Exam Management deadline data
5. **Integration** depends on all previous epics

### **Parallel Development Opportunities**
- Settings App UI and Role System backend can be developed in parallel
- Notification System templates can be developed while Exam Management is in progress
- Performance optimization can run parallel to feature development

## üß™ **TDD TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Test-First Approach for Each Story**
1. **RED Phase:** Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. **GREEN Phase:** Write minimum code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Improve code while keeping tests green

### **Testing Categories Required**
- **Unit Tests:** Component-level functionality
- **Integration Tests:** Cross-app communication
- **Regression Tests:** Existing functionality protection  
- **Performance Tests:** Load time and responsiveness
- **Security Tests:** Role-based access control
- **Mobile Tests:** Touch and responsive design

### **Quality Gates**
- **Code Coverage:** 85% minimum for all new code
- **Performance Budget:** <2s app load, <500ms navigation
- **Security:** 100% role-based access control coverage
- **Regression:** 100% existing functionality protection
