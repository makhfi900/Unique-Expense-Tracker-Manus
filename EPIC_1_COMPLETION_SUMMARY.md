### Architecture & Design Patterns

#### Component Architecture
```
Settings App Structure:
â”œâ”€â”€ SettingsConfiguration.jsx (Main container)
â”œâ”€â”€ RoleManagement.jsx (Story 1.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FeatureVisibilityConfiguration.jsx (Story 1.3)
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useRoles.js (Role management logic)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useFeatureVisibility.js (Feature visibility logic)
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
    â”œâ”€â”€ settings/ (Component tests)
    â””â”€â”€ hooks/ (Hook tests)
```
