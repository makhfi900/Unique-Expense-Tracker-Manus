# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
## Multi-App Educational Institution Management System

### ADR-001: Multi-App Architecture Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Deciders:** System Architect Team  

#### Context
The current single-purpose expense tracking system needs to evolve into a comprehensive educational institution management platform supporting multiple functional areas (Financial, Academic, Administrative).

#### Decision
We will implement a **modular multi-app architecture** with the following structure:
- Expenses App (Enhanced financial management)
- Exams App (Academic assessment management) 
- Settings App (System configuration)

#### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each app focuses on a specific domain
- **Independent Development:** Teams can work on different apps simultaneously
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new apps without affecting existing functionality
- **Maintainability:** Smaller, focused codebases are easier to maintain
- **User Experience:** Users access only relevant functionality based on their roles

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Better organization, parallel development, clearer boundaries
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in navigation and state management
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust navigation manager and shared state system

### ADR-002: Extended Role-Based Access Control

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Deciders:** System Architect, Security Team  

#### Context
Current two-tier role system (admin/account_officer) is insufficient for educational institution needs requiring differentiated access for various staff types.

#### Decision
Implement **four-tier hierarchical role system:**
1. Administrator (highest privilege)
2. Manager (departmental oversight)
3. Teacher (academic focus)
4. Account Officer (financial focus)

#### Rationale
- **Educational Context:** Aligns with typical educational institution hierarchy
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users get minimum necessary access
- **Flexibility:** Granular permissions allow fine-tuned access control
- **Audit Trail:** Clear role definitions enable better security auditing

#### Implementation Strategy
```typescript
interface RoleHierarchy {
  Administrator: {
    inherits: [];
    permissions: ['*']; // All permissions
  };
  Manager: {
    inherits: ['Teacher', 'Account Officer'];
    permissions: ['department:*', 'user:manage'];
  };
  Teacher: {
    inherits: [];
    permissions: ['exam:*', 'student:read', 'grade:*'];
  };
  Account Officer: {
    inherits: [];
    permissions: ['expense:*', 'budget:read', 'report:financial'];
  };
}
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Granular access control, educational institution alignment
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in permission checking
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching for permission checks, clear permission documentation

    [key: string]: {
      roles: string[];
      conditions?: ConditionFunction;
      fallback?: React.ComponentType;
    };
  };
}

class FeatureVisibilityManager {
  isFeatureVisible(featureId: string, user: User): boolean;
  getVisibleNavigation(user: User): NavigationItem[];
  wrapWithPermission(component: React.ComponentType, permission: string): React.ComponentType;
}
```

#### Consequences

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Deciders:** Frontend Team, System Architect  

#### Context
Multi-app architecture requires coordinated state management for shared data while maintaining app independence.

#### Decision
Implement **hybrid state management approach:**
- **Global State (Zustand):** User auth, notifications, shared cache
- **App-Local State (React State):** Feature-specific data and UI state
- **Server State (React Query):** API data with caching and synchronization

#### Architecture
```typescript
// Global Store
interface GlobalStore {
  user: UserState;
  navigation: NavigationState;
  notifications: NotificationState;
  cache: CacheState;
}

// App-Specific Stores
interface ExpenseAppStore {
  filters: ExpenseFilters;
  selectedExpenses: string[];
  bulkOperationMode: boolean;
}

interface ExamAppStore {
  selectedTerm: string;
  gradeEntryMode: boolean;
  examSchedule: ExamSchedule;
}
```

#### Rationale
- **Performance:** Minimal re-renders with targeted updates
- **Independence:** Apps don't interfere with each other's state
- **Consistency:** Shared authentication and navigation state
- **Developer Experience:** Familiar patterns for React developers

    persistent: boolean;
  };
}

class EventBus {
  private subscribers = new Map<string, Function[]>();
  
  publish(event: AppEvent): void;
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: (event: AppEvent) => void): () => void;
  subscribeOnce(eventType: string, handler: (event: AppEvent) => void): void;
}
```

#### Event Categories
