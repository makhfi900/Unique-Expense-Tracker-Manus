# Issue: UI Bugs - Refresh Stuck and Blank Page on Filter

## Description

Two distinct UI bugs have been identified:

1.  **Stuck on Refresh:** After a user logs in, if they refresh the page, the application gets stuck on the "Loading... Initializing Supabase Auth..." screen.
2.  **Blank Page on Filter:** When an admin user clicks the "Show Filters" button on the Expense Management page, the page turns completely white.

## Steps to Reproduce

### Stuck on Refresh
1.  Log in to the application.
2.  Once the dashboard is loaded, refresh the browser page.
3.  Observe that the page is stuck on the loading screen.

### Blank Page on Filter
1.  Log in to the application as an admin user.
2.  Navigate to the "Expenses" tab in the Dashboard Navigation.
3.  Click on the "Show Filters" button.
4.  Observe that the page content disappears and turns white.

## Expected Behavior

-   **Refresh:** The page should reload the dashboard and its components correctly without getting stuck.
-   **Filter:** The filter options should appear on the page, allowing the user to filter the expense list.

## Possible Causes

-   **Stuck on Refresh:** This could be related to how the Supabase authentication state is being checked or re-initialized on page load. There might be a race condition or an unhandled state in the `SupabaseApp.jsx` or `SupabaseAuthContext.jsx`.
-   **Blank Page on Filter:** This might be a JavaScript error in the component responsible for rendering the filters. It could be a state management issue where the component re-renders into a blank state.
