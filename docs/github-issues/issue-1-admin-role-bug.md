# Admin user shows as Account Officer after login

## Bug Description
When logging in with admin credentials (admin@test.com / admin123), the user interface shows the user as an Account Officer instead of Admin, despite having the correct role in both the database and auth metadata.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Login with credentials:
   - Email: admin@test.com
   - Password: admin123
3. Observe that the dashboard shows user as "Account Officer" instead of "Admin"

## Expected Behavior
- User should be recognized as Admin
- Admin-specific features should be available
- Role display should show "Admin"

## Current Behavior
- User is shown as Account Officer
- Admin features may not be accessible
- Incorrect role display in UI

## Technical Details
- **Database role**: `admin` (verified in users table)
- **Auth metadata role**: `admin` (verified in user_metadata)
- **Frontend role detection**: Issue in `SupabaseAuthContext.jsx` lines 218-219

## Root Cause Analysis
The role detection logic in `SupabaseAuthContext.jsx` might not be properly checking the database user profile:

```javascript
// Current logic only checks metadata
const isAdmin = user?.user_metadata?.role === 'admin' || user?.app_metadata?.role === 'admin'
const isAccountOfficer = user?.user_metadata?.role === 'account_officer' || user?.app_metadata?.role === 'account_officer'
```

## Verified Data
**Auth user_metadata:**
```json
{
  "email_verified": true,
  "full_name": "System Administrator",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Database user record:**
```json
{
  "id": "a3fc8908-d1b2-40f1-bb5f-8df90be90102",
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "full_name": "System Administrator",
  "is_active": true
}
```

## Suggested Fix
1. Fetch user profile from database during authentication
2. Use database role as source of truth for role detection
3. Update role detection logic to check database user profile
4. Consider caching database user profile in auth context

## Files to Modify
- `frontend/src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.jsx`
- Potentially components that rely on role detection

## Priority
**High** - Affects core admin functionality and user experience

## Labels
- bug
- authentication
- role-management
- high-priority
- frontend

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Admin user (admin@test.com) shows as Admin in UI
- [x] Role-based features work correctly for Admin users
- [x] Database user profile is properly fetched and used
- [x] Role detection logic is robust and reliable

## Status
**RESOLVED** ✅ - Completed on 2025-07-18

### Implementation Summary
Successfully fixed the admin role detection bug by implementing proper database profile fetching:

#### Root Cause
The auth context was only checking `user_metadata` and `app_metadata` from the Supabase auth user object, but not fetching the actual user profile from the database where the correct role information was stored.

#### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced AuthContext** (`frontend/src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.jsx`)
   - Added `userProfile` state to store database user profile
   - Added `fetchUserProfile()` function to fetch user data from database
   - Modified auth state change handlers to fetch profile on login
   - Updated role detection logic to prioritize database profile role

2. **Updated Dashboard Component** (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`)
   - Added `userProfile` to the auth context destructuring
   - Modified `userInfo` memoization to use database profile data
   - Updated role display to use database profile information

3. **Role Detection Logic**
   - Now checks `userProfile.role` first (database source of truth)
   - Falls back to `user_metadata.role` and `app_metadata.role` as backups
   - Ensures proper role-based feature access

#### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Enhanced role detection logic
const isAdmin = userProfile?.role === 'admin' || 
                user?.user_metadata?.role === 'admin' || 
                user?.app_metadata?.role === 'admin'

// User info now uses database profile
const userInfo = useMemo(() => ({
  name: userProfile?.full_name || user?.user_metadata?.full_name || user?.email,
  role: userProfile?.role || user?.user_metadata?.role || 'account_officer',
  isAdmin,
  isAccountOfficer
}), [userProfile, user, isAdmin, isAccountOfficer])
```

#### Files Updated:
- `frontend/src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`

#### Results:
- ✅ Admin users now correctly show as "Administrator" in the UI
- ✅ Role-based features (Analytics, Users, Categories) properly accessible
- ✅ Database user profile is fetched and used as source of truth
- ✅ Robust role detection with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ No performance impact with proper memoization
