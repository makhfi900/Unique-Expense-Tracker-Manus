# Issue #5: Analytics Date Range Filtering Problem

## Problem Description
The Analytics tab is working correctly but shows empty data (Rs 0.00, 0 expenses) because the default date range filter is too narrow and excludes most expense data.

## Current Behavior
- **Default Date Range**: 2025-06-30 to 2025-07-27 (approximately 1 month)
- **Total Spent**: Rs 0.00 
- **Total Expenses**: 0
- **Categories Used**: 0 of 9 Available
- **Charts**: Empty Monthly Spending Trends and Category Breakdown

## Expected Behavior
- **Default Date Range**: Should be wider (e.g., "This Year" or "Last 6 Months") to capture meaningful data
- **Total Spent**: Should show Rs 14,850 (total of sample expenses)
- **Total Expenses**: Should show 10 expenses
- **Categories Used**: Should show usage across multiple categories
- **Charts**: Should display meaningful trends and breakdowns

## Sample Data in Database
The database contains 10 sample expenses totaling Rs 14,850 across dates from January 2025 to July 2025:

- Jan 15, 2025: Laptop for office (Rs 2,500) - Technology
- Feb 20, 2025: Team lunch meeting (Rs 850) - Food & Dining  
- Mar 10, 2025: Monthly phone bill (Rs 1,200) - Utilities
- Apr 5, 2025: Conference travel (Rs 3,500) - Travel
- May 12, 2025: Office supplies (Rs 600) - Office Supplies
- Jun 18, 2025: Client dinner (Rs 950) - Food & Dining
- Jul 25, 2025: Marketing materials (Rs 1,800) - Marketing
- Jul 26, 2025: Taxi to airport (Rs 450) - Transportation
- Plus 2 existing expenses

## Root Cause
1. **Narrow Default Range**: The "This Month" preset creates a filter from 2025-06-30 to 2025-07-27
2. **Date Filter Logic**: Only 2 expenses (Jul 25 & Jul 26) fall within this range
3. **UI Issue**: Date range inputs don't accept manual changes properly

## Technical Details
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/EnhancedAnalytics.jsx`
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/analytics/spending-trends`, `/api/analytics/category-breakdown`
- **Database**: Sample data exists but is filtered out by date range

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login as admin (admin1@test.com / admin123)
2. Navigate to Analytics tab
3. Observe empty metrics despite data existing in database
4. Try to change start date from 06/30/2025 to 01/01/2025
5. Date reverts back to original range

## Proposed Solution
1. **Change Default Range**: Set default to "This Year" or "Last 6 Months" instead of "This Month"
2. **Fix Date Input**: Ensure manual date changes are properly accepted and trigger data refresh
3. **Add Quick Presets**: Include options like "Last 3 Months", "Last 6 Months", "This Year"
4. **Validation**: Ensure date range changes properly trigger API calls

## Priority
**Medium** - Analytics functionality works but needs better default settings to show meaningful data

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: admin1@test.com
- **Password**: admin123
