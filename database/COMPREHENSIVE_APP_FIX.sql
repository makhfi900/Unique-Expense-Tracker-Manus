-- 4. ENSURE BASIC TABLES HAVE PROPER PERMISSIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Ensure basic table permissions are working
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE expenses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any overly restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_select_own" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_select_admin" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "expenses_select_own" ON expenses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "expenses_select_admin" ON expenses;

-- Create working policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their profile and admins can view all" ON users
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
    USING (auth.uid() = id OR EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    ));

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their profile" ON users
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated 
    USING (auth.uid() = id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their expenses and admins can view all" ON expenses
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
    USING (
        (auth.uid() = user_id AND is_active = true) OR 
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own expenses" ON expenses

-- =====================================================
-- 5. REFRESH ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_category_spending;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_user_spending;
